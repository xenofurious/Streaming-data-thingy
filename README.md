# Streaming-data-thingy

this is a tool i want to work on that would allow me to display my spotify streaming stats.
i'm not sure how far this is going to go at the moment, but i first want to get basic spotify stats working
my goal for far in the future is to manage to create a database of matching artists (between different streaming services) and using MBID as a key so that i can sync streaming stats from multiple platforms at the same time, and then using this tool to view them
